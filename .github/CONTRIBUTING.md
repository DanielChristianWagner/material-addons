## Process for developing a new component/demo page

1. Every new component should be developed in a local fork, for detailed description how to use forks for PR see [github & forks](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)
2. You should be able to create a Pull Request from your forked repository.
3. The pull request gets reviewed by a reviewer and corrected by the developer if needed. Please assign @markus-ebner and/or @Laess3r.
4. After all checks have passed, the pull request gets merged into master as a single squashed commit.
